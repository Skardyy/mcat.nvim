# TODO:

* the project is going to use mcat directly (no auto install mechanic)
* should be locked to a certain mcat version (and above maybe)

### Presets 
- inline (images), works in kitty/ascii and should have different methods of doing it so (full, below, right)
- open (everything), simply opens the file and prints the content into the buffer. should work for markdown too just pass the `-c` flag
- open_float, same as open just in a float.
- interact, like `-o interactive` in mcat.
- interact_float, like interact just in a float.
- hover, should open a small float next to the cursor and show the content of the hovered path/url (maybe needs cutting)
- oil_preview, override the selected file extension's preview into content generated by mcat.

> NOTES
> - dirs should be applicable through the ls command
> - gifs/videos should be treated with caution and should be disabled by default in most things -- can't ensure the size will match
